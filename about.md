Me
-------

I am a software engineer living in Cambridge (UK), with a fascination for
how things work. I aim to produce code that is clean, correct, performant and
that does some good in the world.

This blog is a place for random thoughts and musings on things that interest
me, mostly of a technical nature.

Work
----------

At [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) as a senior backend developer, I am a
maintainer of [GitLab Rails](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) currently
building the future of work.

I have a particular interest in reliable, scalable and composable APIs, with
a particular focus on GraphQL.
